implemented as long as they make customers happy.

⚒️ How to do it?

● For styling purposes, you can use Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, CSS, CSS Modules, or
any other CSS library of your choice.

● You should not be using any package/library apart from styling purposes.
● Do not include node_modules in the zip, and should not copy functionality from the internet.
